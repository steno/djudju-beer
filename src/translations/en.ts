        'DjuDju priests and priestesses were spiritual and practical healers. Non medicinal drinks were also brewed for celebrations, for example for weddings or the birth of a child. DjuDju was made in large clay pots according to ancient recipes and traditions and served to guests by the DjuDju Queen in Calabash bowls. This is where the origin of the modern day DjuDju fruit beers can be found.',
        'Motivated by the huge amount of positive feedback from visitors to Ghana, the Tagoe family decided, in cooperation with an international brewery, to sell fruit beer based on their secret recipe outside of the country.',
